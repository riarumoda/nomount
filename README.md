# NoMount

> WARNING: This project operates directly at the kernel VFS layer and is intended for research and development. Also this project may contain bugs. Proceed with caution.

**NoMount** is a kernel-based file injection and path redirection framework for Android kernels.

Unlike traditional root solutions that rely on `mount --bind` (which pollutes `/proc/mounts`, changes mount namespaces, and is easily detected), NoMount operates **purely at the VFS (Virtual File System) layer**. It manipulates path resolution and directory iteration directly inside the kernel, making injections effective yet virtually invisible to userspace detection methods.

## Why NoMount?

Traditional methods (such a Magic Mount) modify the mount table. Some detectors and banking apps scan `/proc/self/mountinfo` to find these anomalies.

**NoMount changes the paradigm:**

1. **No Mounts:** No `mount()` syscalls are ever used. The mount table remains 100% stock.
2. **Visual Injection:** Uses advanced `iterate_dir` hooking to make "new" files appear in read-only directories (like `/vendor`) without physically touching the partition.
3. **Files Redireccion:** Any file passed through `getname_hook` is intercepted by NoMount, ensuring that any file can be redirected from anywhere.
4. **Native Permission Delegation:** By seamlessly redirecting the underlying inode without permission hooks, it inherently bypasses restrictions while keeping **SELinux** perfectly intact.

## Key Features

* **Transparent Path Redirection:** Intercepts a target VFS path (e.g., `/system/app/YouTube/YouTube.apk`) and redirects the file descriptor to a modified file in a different partition (e.g., `/data`). The userspace process is unaware of the redirection.
* **VFS Directory Injection:** Injects completely new file or directory entries into read-only system paths. Using custom `iterate_dir` kernel hooks, injected files appear natively in standard `readdir` calls, `ls` outputs, and Java `File.list()`.
* **Security Context Bypass:** `inode_permission` and `generic_permission` hooks ensure that the injected files can be traversed and read, while correctly simulating the typical attributes of system partitions.
* **UID-Based Rule Isolation:** Utilizes a hash table to filter active rules per process UID. Specific applications can be isolated to see the 100% stock filesystem without any applied injections.

## Kernel Integration

Please see [kernel/README.md](kernel/README.md) for detailed kernel-side integration, patch instructions, and atchitecture details.

## Usage (Userspace)

The subsystem is controlled via the [`nm`](userspace/src/nm.c) binary communicating through a custom IOCTL interface.

| Command | Syntax | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Add Rule** | `nm add <virtual> <real>` | Inject `real` file at `virtual` path. |
| **Delete Rule** | `nm del <virtual>` | Remove a specific injection rule. |
| **Remove Rule** | `nm rm <virtual>` | Alias for `del`. |
| **Block UID** | `nm block <uid>` | Isolate UID from seeing any injections. |
| **Unblock UID** | `nm unblock <uid>` | Restore injection visibility for UID. |
| **List Rules** | `nm ls [json]` | Show currently active rules (supports standard or `json` output). |
| **Clear All** | `nm clear` | Flush all rules and UID blocks immediately. |
| **Version** | `nm ver` | Show the kernel subsystem version. |

### Examples

**Inject a custom library:**

```bash
# The system thinks libfoo.so is in /vendor, but it loads from /data
nm add /vendor/lib64/soundfx/libfoo.so /data/local/tmp/my_lib.so

```

**Replace a config file:**

```bash
# Instantly replace audio configs system-wide
nm add /vendor/etc/audio_effects.conf /data/adb/modules/my_mod/audio_effects.conf

```

**Redirect any file:**
```bash
# nm binary recognize relative paths, reconstruct it internally and redirect file correctly
nm add test temp

```

**Hide root from a banking app:**

```bash
# App with UID 10256 will see the stock system, no injections
nm block 10256

```
